# HPC4M Global Minima of Benchmark Optimisation Problems

Aim: Implement algorithms to find the global minima of the Eggholder function and Shekel function exploiting parallel architectures in an orderly C++ way.

> Repository for Maxwell Institute Advanced Course: High Performance Computing for Mathematicians

## Getting Started

These implementations use [Eigen 3.3.9](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for its linear algebra. I place Eigen in the root directory – it is ignored on pushing (See `.gitignore`). Then to compile the file `gd.cpp` with Eigen using g++ on Windows,

```
g++ -I .\eigen-3.3.9 GradientDescent\gd.cpp -o gd.exe
```
On Linux you'll just need to change the file separators to `/`.

## Test Objective Functions

All the functions `f` we are interested in map from R^d to R. To use them, simply declare them as `FunctionName f(dim)` where `dim` is an `int` describing the dimension of the problem. For example `Quadratic f(10)` . Then there are two associated functions `f.evaluate(x)` and `f.gradient(x)` evaluating the function and its gradient at the point `x` respectively. Below is a list of current test functions: 

- `Quadratic`:

    A quadratic function (convex, one minimum at x=0)

    - Defined as f : R^N \to R, f(x) = x^T x. If d=1, this is f(x) = x^2. In 2d, f(x)=  x_0^2 + x_1^2. 
    - The gradient is calculated exactly, \grad_x f(x) = 2x 

- `DoubleWell1D` 

    A one-dimensional double well potential with two minima at x =  \pm 1/sqrt(2). Asserts that the given dimension is equal to 1.

    - Defined as f : R \to R, f(x) = x^4 - x^2
    - Gradient is calculated exactly, \grad_x f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x

- `UnevenDoubleWell1D`

    A one-dimensional double well that has one deeper well, global minimum at x = (3+sqrt(41))/8 \approx 1.1754. Asserts the given dimension is equal to 1.

    - Defined as f : R \to R, f(x) = x^4 - x^3  - x^2
    - Gradient is calculated exactly, \grad_x f(x) = 4x^3 - 3x^2 - 2x

- `Eggholder`

    The [Eggholder function](http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/egg.html) in two dimensions for x \in [-512,512]^2. Global minimum at x = (512,404.2319). 

    - Defined as f : R^2 \to R, f(x) = -(x_1 + 47)sin(sqrt(abs((x_0 /2) + x_1+47))) - x_0 sin(sqrt(abs(x_0 - x_1 - 47)))
    - Gradient calculated numerically using `BaseObjective::gradient` 

- `Shekel`

    The [Shekel function](http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/shekel.html) for x \in [0,10]^4. There are 10 local minima with the global minimum at x = (4, 4, 4, 4).

    - Gradient calculated numerically using `BaseObjective::gradient`. 

## Using the Test Functions

See `main()` in  `gd.cpp` for an example of using the gradient descent algorithm. 

## Contributing 

All of the below is subject to change as the project develops and the need for more functionality arises.

### Using Eigen

There is a [handy quick reference for Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/AsciiQuickReference.txt) . The main type used is `Eigen::VectorXd` – a vector of unknown length (`X`) containing doubles (`d`). These can be written to `cout` directly (`std::cout << v ;`). 

One thing to be careful of is whether operations should be done using vector arithmetic or elementwise arithmetic. If you require the latter use `v.array()`. This is used to take elementwise powers, among other things. Some common elementwise operations have their own functions – check the documentation before using `.array()`.

### Implementing Test Functions

All test functions are classes defined in `testfun.hpp`, containing two methods:

- `double evaluate(const Eigen::VectorXd& x)`  
    - Evaluates the function at the given point `x`, f(x)
- `Eigen::VectorXd gradient(const Eigen::VectorXd& x)` 
    - Calculates the gradient of the function at the given point `x` . \grad_x f(x) 

The test functions all inherit the base class `BaseObjective`, which takes as it's only argument the dimension of the function `d` . *This class should not be used directly, only inherited.*   

- `BaseObjective`: 

    - `gradient` is approximated using centred finite differences with step size `EPSILON`. 

    - `evalute` is a virtual function that should be overloaded in any subclass. If called directly it will terminate the program.

        

### Implementing Methods

Methods should be in their own file, `algo.cpp` and include the `testfun.hpp` header. (In future it may be better to have these in a header file too…) . Methods should take:

-  an objective function `f` (ObjFunc)
-  a maximum number of iterations `max_iter` (int)
- an initial value `int_val` (Eigen::VectorXd)
- a step size `gam` (double)
- tolerances
    - on the change in solution `rel_sol_change_tol` (double)
    - on the change in gradient `grad_change_tol` (double)

They should return a vector `step` that is the point at which the minimum of the objective function `f` occurs. 



## Future Work

### C++ Software Structure 

- [x]  Use of Eigen or Armadillo?
- [x] ~~Intel MKL for distributed linear algebra~~ We aren't working with large enough dimensions to make this worthwhile

### Basic Algorithms

Algorithms:
- [x] Gradient Descent
- [ ] Stochastic Gradient Descent
- [x] BFGS 
- [ ] Nelder Mead

Opportunities to parallelise?
Crossover with sampling algorithms?

### Algorithms Designed for Parallel

- [ ] Particle Swarm -- better to hunt as a swarm or packs (i.e. local or global interaction)?
- [ ] Ant/Bee Colony
- [ ] Genetic/Evolutionary Algorithms
- [ ] Work of Lelievre? -- parallel replica algorithm (possibly for metastable particle systems rather than optimisation)
